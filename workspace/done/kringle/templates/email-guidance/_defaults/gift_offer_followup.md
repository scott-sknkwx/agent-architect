# Gift Offer Follow-up Email Guidance

## Purpose
This email follows up on the initial outreach when we haven't received a response. The goal is still to get permission to send the EEX sequence.

## Context
- First email was sent ~48 hours ago
- No response received
- This is our last attempt before timing out the reach_out phase

## Tone
- Even more brief than the first email
- Casual bump, not desperate follow-up
- No guilt-tripping about not responding

## Structure

### Opening (1 sentence)
Very brief acknowledgment that you're following up.

**Good examples:**
- "Quick follow-up on this."
- "Circling back."
- "Bumping this up."

**Avoid:**
- "Just wanted to check if you saw my last email"
- "I know you're busy, but..."
- "Not sure if this got lost"

### Value Reframe (1-2 sentences)
Restate the value proposition with a different angle. Don't repeat the first email.

**Good examples:**
- "The third email in the series covers why intent data providers often miss the mark—thought that might resonate."
- "Quick read, no strings attached."
- "A few teams have told me email 2 alone was worth it."

**Avoid:**
- Repeating the same pitch
- Adding pressure
- Making it longer than the first email

### Call to Action (1 sentence)
Even softer than the first email.

**Good examples:**
- "Want me to send it?"
- "Interested?"
- "Say the word."

**Avoid:**
- "Let me know either way"
- "If I don't hear back, I'll assume..."
- Multiple CTAs

### Sign-off
- First name only
- Identical to first email

## Length
- Total: 30-60 words (shorter than first email)
- Subject line: Reply to original thread OR new short subject

## Subject Line Options
- Reply to original thread (Re: [original subject])
- New subject: "bump", "quick follow-up", "still relevant?"

## Personalization
1. **Required**: Use their first name
2. **Optional**: Reference a different aspect of the EEX
3. **Optional**: New angle based on their role/industry

## What NOT to Do
- Don't reference that they didn't respond
- Don't add more information than the first email
- Don't change the tone (stay casual)
- Don't add urgency or scarcity
- Don't make it feel like you're tracking them
