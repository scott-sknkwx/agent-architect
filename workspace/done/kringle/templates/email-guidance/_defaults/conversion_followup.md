# Post-EEX Conversion Follow-up Email Guidance

## Purpose
This is the final email in the sequence. The lead completed the EEX and didn't respond to the first conversion email. This is our last attempt to start a conversation.

## Context
- Lead completed full EEX
- First conversion email sent ~48 hours ago
- No response to any conversion outreach
- This is the final touch before timing out

## Tone
- Brief and direct
- No desperation or guilt
- Give them an easy out while leaving the door open

## Structure

### Opening (1 sentence)
Brief bump, acknowledge this is a follow-up.

**Good examples:**
- "One more thought before I let this go."
- "Last note on this."
- "Circling back once more."

**Avoid:**
- "I haven't heard back..."
- "I know you're busy..."
- "Just checking in"

### Final Value Proposition (1-2 sentences)
One clear reason why a conversation could be valuable.

**Good examples:**
- "If the compound pipeline effect resonated, I can share how teams are actually implementing it."
- "Happy to walk through the numbers if you want to see whether this makes sense for your traffic."
- "A quick call could help you decide if this is worth exploring—no commitment."

**Avoid:**
- Repeating everything from previous emails
- Adding new concepts or content
- Being vague

### Low-Commitment CTA (1 sentence)
Make it easy to say yes OR no.

**Good examples:**
- "Worth 15 minutes?"
- "Yes or no, either way—just wanted to offer."
- "If timing's off, no worries. Happy to reconnect down the road."

**Avoid:**
- Open-ended questions
- Multiple options
- "Let me know what you think"

### Sign-off
- First name only
- Consistent with all previous emails

## Length
- Total: 40-60 words (shortest email in the sequence)
- Subject line: Simple follow-up or new angle

## Subject Line Options
- Thread reply: Re: [previous subject]
- New: "one more thought", "last note", "timing"

## Personalization
1. **Required**: Use their first name
2. **Optional**: Reference a specific takeaway from EEX

## What NOT to Do
- Don't make them feel bad for not responding
- Don't add urgency or deadlines
- Don't send additional resources
- Don't offer multiple meeting options
- Don't extend the sequence further
- Don't mention that this is your last email (it's implied)

## If They Don't Respond
This lead will be marked as timed out (terminated, reason: timeout). They can re-enter the system if they visit the website again in the future.
