# Gift Offer Email Guidance (Initial Outreach)

## Purpose
This email introduces Kringle's Educational Email Experience (EEX) to a lead who visited our partner's website. The goal is to get permission to send the EEX sequence.

## Tone
- Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-prospect
- Consultative and helpful, not salesy
- Brief and respectful of their time

## Structure

### Opening (1 sentence)
Reference something specific about them:
- A recent LinkedIn post or article they wrote
- The specific page they visited on the website
- Their company's recent news (funding, product launch, etc.)
- A pattern you've seen with people in their role

**Good examples:**
- "Your post about the MQL quality problem hit close to home."
- "Noticed you were checking out the pricing page—happens a lot around Series B."
- "Congrats on the recent funding round."

**Avoid:**
- Generic openers: "Hope this finds you well"
- Mentioning that you know they visited (creepy)
- Obvious flattery

### Problem Statement (1-2 sentences)
Name a pain point relevant to their persona. Don't assume—use conditional framing.

**Good examples:**
- "Most teams at your stage realize their website traffic isn't converting."
- "If you're like most VPs of Eng I talk to, your pipeline problem isn't traffic—it's identification."

**Avoid:**
- Being presumptuous about their specific situation
- Listing multiple problems
- Jargon or buzzwords

### Value Offer (1-2 sentences)
Introduce the EEX as educational content, not a pitch.

**Good examples:**
- "We put together a 5-email breakdown of what's working for companies in your position."
- "I wrote up the patterns we've seen across 40+ B2B teams."

**Key points:**
- Emphasize it's educational, not promotional
- Mention it's a series (sets expectation)
- Reference social proof (number of companies)

### Call to Action (1 sentence)
Soft ask. Not "let's schedule a call."

**Good examples:**
- "Worth a look?"
- "Interested?"
- "Want me to send it over?"

**Avoid:**
- Hard CTAs: "Can we schedule 15 minutes?"
- Multiple CTAs
- Urgency tactics

### Sign-off
- First name only
- No title, no company, no phone number
- Keep it casual

## Length
- Total: 60-100 words
- Subject line: Under 50 characters, lowercase preferred

## Subject Line Patterns
Use messaging_angles.yaml for persona-specific patterns. Defaults:
- Reference their content: "that pipeline post"
- Pattern recognition: "post-Series B pipeline"
- Direct question: "visitor → lead?"

## Personalization Requirements
1. **Required**: Use their first name naturally (not "Dear")
2. **Required**: Reference something specific (page visited, role context, or company context)
3. **Optional**: Reference a specific pain point from their industry

## What NOT to Do
- Don't mention Kringle by name
- Don't pitch a demo or call
- Don't use "I hope this email finds you well"
- Don't use exclamation points
- Don't use marketing buzzwords (revolutionary, game-changing, etc.)
