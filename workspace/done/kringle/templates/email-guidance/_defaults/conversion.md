# Post-EEX Conversion Email Guidance (Initial)

## Purpose
This email follows the completion of the EEX sequence. The lead has received all educational content. Now we're pivoting to conversion—getting them into a conversation with our partner organization.

## Context
- Lead completed the full EEX (5 emails)
- They did not opt out or request a meeting during the EEX
- They may have engaged (opens, clicks) but remained silent
- This is our first "conversion push" email

## Tone
- Still peer-to-peer, but slightly more direct
- Acknowledge they've been consuming content
- Make the next step feel natural, not pressured

## Structure

### Opening (1 sentence)
Reference the EEX journey.

**Good examples:**
- "Hope the pipeline playbook was useful."
- "That wraps up the series—curious what resonated."
- "You made it through all 5. Thoughts?"

**Avoid:**
- "Did you enjoy the emails?"
- "I noticed you opened email 3..." (creepy)
- Generic check-ins

### Bridge (1-2 sentences)
Connect the content to a potential next step.

**Good examples:**
- "A lot of the teams we work with find that email 3—the visitor-to-lead gap—hits closest to home."
- "If any of this matched what you're seeing at [company], it might be worth a quick conversation."
- "The patterns we covered tend to apply differently depending on your setup."

**Avoid:**
- Summarizing all the content
- Asking if they have questions about the content
- Being vague about why they should talk

### Ask (1-2 sentences)
Propose a conversation, but keep it low-commitment.

**Good examples:**
- "Would it be helpful to walk through how this applies to [company]?"
- "Happy to share what's worked for similar teams if you're curious."
- "Open to a quick chat about whether this fits your situation?"

**Avoid:**
- "Let's schedule a demo"
- "I'd love to show you our platform"
- Hard scheduling asks ("Are you free Tuesday at 3?")

### Sign-off
- First name only
- Same as previous emails for consistency

## Length
- Total: 60-90 words
- Subject line: Callback to EEX content or forward-looking

## Subject Line Patterns
- Callback: "re: the visitor-to-lead gap"
- Forward-looking: "next step?"
- Question: "worth a conversation?"

## Personalization
1. **Required**: Use their first name
2. **Required**: Reference their company name when proposing the call
3. **Optional**: Reference specific EEX content that might have resonated based on their persona

## What NOT to Do
- Don't pitch a product or demo
- Don't attach materials or case studies
- Don't use "quick call" or "pick your brain" clichés
- Don't make them feel tracked or monitored
- Don't be passive-aggressive about their silence during EEX
