    {first_name},

    Yesterday I mentioned that 97% of your website visitors leave unknown. Today, let's talk about the solution most companies try first: intent data.

    The pitch is compelling. Third-party intent data tells you who's researching your category. You can see which companies are "in-market."

    But here's the problem: that data tells you who's researching *your category*. It doesn't tell you who's researching *you*.

    Your website visitors are different. They're already on your site. They're already reading your content. They're showing first-party intent—the strongest signal there is.

    And yet most companies have no system to capture it.

    Think about it: you're paying for third-party signals about strangers while ignoring first-party signals from people actively evaluating you.

    Tomorrow: why the gap between "someone visited your site" and "sales has a conversation" is where most pipeline dies.
