    Let's say you solve the identification problem. You now know that Sarah Chen, VP of Engineering at Acme Corp, visited your pricing page yesterday.

    What happens next?

    In most companies: nothing useful.

    The data sits in a dashboard. Maybe someone exports it to a spreadsheet. An SDR might add them to a sequence—three days later, with a generic email.

    By then, Sarah's moved on. She's talked to two competitors. The moment is gone.

    This is the visitor-to-lead gap. The time between "we know who visited" and "we're having a real conversation."

    Most companies measure traffic. They measure MQLs. They measure opportunities.

    But almost nobody measures this gap. And it's where pipeline goes to die.

    The companies we work with have shrunk this gap from days to hours. Some to minutes.
