    Here's the outbound dilemma:

    Spray-and-pray doesn't work anymore. Reply rates are dropping. Spam filters are smarter. Buyers are exhausted.

    But true 1:1 personalization doesn't scale. You can't have an SDR spend 20 minutes researching every visitor.

    So what's the answer?

    Context-aware automation.

    It works like this: when someone visits your site, you don't just capture their identity. You capture their *context*. What pages they viewed. What content they engaged with. What their company is doing.

    Then you use that context to personalize automatically. Not "Hi {first_name}" personalization. Real, relevant personalization.

    "Saw Acme just raised Series B—congrats. Usually that's when engineering teams feel pressure to scale fast."

    That's specific. That's relevant. And it can be generated in seconds, not minutes.

    Tomorrow: the compound effect—why this isn't a campaign, it's a capability.
