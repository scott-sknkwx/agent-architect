  title: "The Pipeline Recovery Playbook"
  core_promise: "Learn how to turn your anonymous website traffic into qualified pipeline—without adding more tools or headcount."
  villain: "The belief that more traffic or better content alone will fix your pipeline problem."
  format: "5 emails over 10 days, ~15 minutes total read time"
  proof_point: "Based on patterns from 40+ B2B companies that recovered 20-40% more pipeline from existing traffic."

topics:
  email_1:
    topic: "The Invisible Pipeline Problem"
    takeaway: "97% of your website visitors leave without ever becoming known leads—and most companies have no strategy to change that."
    belief_shift: "Traffic volume isn't the problem. Identification is."

  email_2:
    topic: "Why Intent Data Isn't Enough"
    takeaway: "Third-party intent data tells you who's researching your category—but your own website visitors are researching YOU."
    belief_shift: "First-party intent (your site visitors) beats third-party intent."

  email_3:
    topic: "The Visitor-to-Lead Gap"
    takeaway: "The gap between 'someone visited your pricing page' and 'sales has a conversation' is where most pipeline dies."
    belief_shift: "Speed and personalization of follow-up matters more than volume."

  email_4:
    topic: "Personalization That Scales"
    takeaway: "Spray-and-pray outreach is dying. But 1:1 personalization doesn't scale. The answer is context-aware automation."
    belief_shift: "You can have both scale and genuine personalization."

  email_5:
    topic: "The Compound Effect"
    takeaway: "When you identify, enrich, and engage visitors in a loop, pipeline compounds. Each month builds on the last."
    belief_shift: "This isn't a campaign—it's a capability that keeps producing."
